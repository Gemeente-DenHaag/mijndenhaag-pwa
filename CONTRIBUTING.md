# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Read [our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if you have not done so already.

## Foundation for Public Code

As an open-source project, to ensure the code remains readable and inviting to contributors, all written code must adhere to the Foundation for Public Codeâ€™s [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net/).
The criteria to which the code must adhere can be found [here](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/).
These criteria concern code as well as the repository itself and the surrounding documentation.
For convenience, all criteria relevant for contributors are listed below, with their respective links to the standard as defined by the Foundation for Public Code.

- **[Document the code](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/documenting.html)**
  <br />
  _See the Code docs section for more information on the documentation._

  - All functionality of the codebase MUST be described in language clearly understandable for those that understand the purpose of the code.
  - The documentation of the codebase MUST contain:
    - a description of how to install and run the source code;
    - examples demonstrating the key functionality.

- **[Maintain version control](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/version-control-and-history.html)**

  - Version control MUST be maintained for all written code.
  - All decisions MUST be documented using commit messages, so that components can be versioned accordingly. If a contribution stems from an issue or discussion, they MUST always be linked.
  - Component versioning is done through Lerna, by maintainers of the repository. Collaborators do not need to increment versions.

- **[Use a coherent style](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/style.html)**

  - All written code must adhere to the defined code style and should pass automated tests on style. Code should contain inline comments and documentation for non-trivial sections.
  - Consult this document as well as the JavaScript Standard Style and the provided linters in the project to ensure your code complies.

- **[Use plain English](https://standard.publiccode.net/criteria/understandable-english-first.html)**
  - All code and documentation MUST be in English.
  - There SHOULD be no acronyms, abbreviations, puns or legal/domain specific terms in the codebase without an explanation preceding it or a link to an explanation.
  - Documentation SHOULD aim for lower secondary education reading level, as recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.

## CODE Style

Code style is to be determined.
